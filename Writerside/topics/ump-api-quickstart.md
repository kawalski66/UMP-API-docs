# UMP API Quickstart

This document describes how to start using the UAS Management Portal (UMP) API, including authorization, authentication,
and accessing API resources. In this section, you'll find a step-by-step guide to quickly start using the API.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the API, ensure you have the following in place:

* A valid SIS (Staff Information System) account with appropriate access permissions.
* Your account has to be allowed by your system administrator to use UMP.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the UMP API follow these steps to get your token:

1. Log in to the UMP portal.
2. Navigate to the API settings section.
3. Generate a new API key or token.
4. Copy the token for use in your API requests.

Include the token in your request headers as shown below:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Making Your First Request

Here is a simple example of making a GET request to one of the API's endpoints to retrieve UAS data:

```http
GET /api/uas/data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.ump.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Example with cURL

```cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.ump.com/api/uas/data" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Response Handling

API responses are returned in JSON format. Hereâ€™s an example of handling a response in Python:

```Java
import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Service
public class UmpApiService {

    private final String API_URL = "https://api.ump.com/api/uas/data";
    private final String ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

    public String getUasData() {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer " + ACCESS_TOKEN);

        HttpEntity<String> entity = new HttpEntity<>(headers);

        ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.exchange(API_URL, HttpMethod.GET, entity, String.class);

        if (response.getStatusCode().is2xxSuccessful()) {
            return response.getBody();
        } else {
            return "Error: " + response.getStatusCodeValue() + ", " + response.getBody();
        }
    }
}

```

## API Usage Tips

- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of the rate limits. The standard rate limit is 70 requests per minute.
- **Error Handling**: Always check for error responses and handle them gracefully in your application.
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimize your queries to request only the necessary data to reduce load and improve performance.

## Next Steps

After making your first request, you can:

- Explore additional endpoints in the API documentation.
- Integrate the API into your application to automate UAS data management.
- Use advanced features like filtering and sorting to tailor the data to your needs.
